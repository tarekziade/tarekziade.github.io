Welcome to my new blog ðŸŽ‰  

For years I have used Pelican to publish my blog, but I wanted to try something new
and that did not require running my own server.

Iâ€™m now using **Jekyll** + **GitHub Pages** to publish posts.  
This setup is lightweight, fast, and lets me write everything in plain Markdown.  

Hereâ€™s what you can expect here:
- Notes on programming and open source
- Experiments with web technologies
- Personal projects
- Occasional posts about running, cycling, and marathons

Thanks for stopping by â€” more posts soon!
