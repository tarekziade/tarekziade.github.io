Artificial intelligence is becoming a foundational layer of modern software. It is
no longer confined to research labs, but embedded directly in everyday tools and
user experiences.

As AI moves closer to users, openness becomes a question of power. Who can inspect
these systems? Who can adapt them? And who ultimately controls how they evolve?

The web offers a useful reference point. Open source software and open standards
turned the World Wide Web into shared infrastructure rather than a proprietary
stack owned by a single company or government, even if many tried to enclose parts
of it. That openness was not accidental. It shaped who could participate, compete,
and be held accountable.

## What Open Source AI Enables

Open source AI is often reduced to code availability. In practice, and as the Open
Source Initiative (OSI) emphasizes in its Open Source AI Definition, it is about
concrete freedoms.

An open source AI system can be used, studied, modified, and shared. Studying means
inspecting behavior, limits, and failure modes. Modifying means adapting models to
new domains, languages, or constraints. Sharing means deploying systems without
being locked to a single vendor or API.

These freedoms must apply not only to code, but also to models, weights, and the
tooling required to run them. Without that access, reuse is brittle and
understanding remains shallow.

Open source enables verification, reproducibility, and portability. It allows
systems to be audited, adapted, and redeployed independently. In a field defined
by cost, scale, and complexity, these are not luxuries. They are prerequisites for
agency.

Open access does not eliminate power imbalances. Compute, data, and expertise still
matter. But it preserves the possibility of independent action, which is often the
difference between participation and dependency.

## Open Standards and Shared Infrastructure

Open source alone is not enough. Open standards define shared interfaces that allow
independently built systems to work together.

The web proved this model at global scale. By separating interfaces from
implementations, standards enabled competition without fragmentation. In AI,
standards around model formats, inference interfaces, evaluation, and data
documentation can lower switching costs and prevent ecosystems from hardening into
silos controlled by a few gatekeepers.

Without standards, “openness” risks collapsing into a collection of incompatible
artifacts, each tied to its own platform or service.

## Looking Ahead

Some infrastructure works best when treated as a common good. The web’s resilience
came from the fact that no single actor owned its foundations.

AI is on track to become similar infrastructure. The question is not whether it
will be powerful, but whether it will be governable.

If core models, datasets, and interfaces are only accessible through proprietary
APIs and cloud platforms, then “AI adoption” will mostly mean dependency. Choice
will be limited to pricing tiers, usage caps, and terms of service.

Not everything should be owned and monetized by a small number of companies.
Projects like Mozilla’s Common Voice show that shared assets can be built and
maintained in the open, at meaningful scale.

Shared infrastructure also depends on shared spaces. Platforms like Hugging Face
play a critical role by enabling collaboration around models, datasets, and tools,
and by lowering the barrier to participation in open AI ecosystems.

Open source and open standards are not about nostalgia or ideology. They are about
keeping the option to walk away. To inspect. To fork. To rebuild.

Once that option is gone, it is rarely recovered.
