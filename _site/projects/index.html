<h1 id="side-projects">Side Projects</h1>

<p>Outside of my professional roles, I explore building developer-focused tools that solve real-world problems.</p>

<h2 id="python-dev">Python-dev</h2>

<p>I was part of the <strong>Python core development team</strong>, with a focus on <strong>packaging
tooling</strong> such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distutils</code>.  During that time, I contributed to shaping
several PEPs in the packaging ecosystem and developed features that landed in
the Python standard library.</p>

<p>Although I eventually stepped back due to the lack of time,
the experience taught me a great deal about large-scale open source
collaboration and the challenges of balancing community needs with technical
constraints.</p>

<h2 id="flake8">Flake8</h2>

<p>I am the <strong>original author of Flake8</strong>, a linting tool that combines
<strong>PyFlakes</strong> and <strong>pep8</strong> hence the name <em>Flake8</em>.  I created it to streamline
Python code quality checks into a single, easy-to-use tool.</p>

<p>I handed over maintenance of Flake8 many years ago, and the community has
continued to evolve it. These days, I often recommend
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff"><strong>Ruff</strong></a>, which offers similar
functionality with a much faster Rust-based implementation.</p>

<h2 id="molotov">Molotov</h2>

<p>One of my main focuses throughout my career has been building tools that help
developers work more effectively, while ensuring they remain open source.</p>

<p>When we began developing web services at Mozilla, such as Firefox Sync, the scale we
had to support was massive, so we needed a reliable way to run load tests.</p>

<p>Plenty of tools already existed, but none were simple enough to let us build and
execute tests quickly. At first, we tried a “smart” approach: a central HTTP
service coordinating agents that ran the tests. But it quickly became clear this
didn’t scale well—you ended up fighting to scale the testing framework itself.<br />
We eventually shifted to using cloud vendor orchestration services and existing
dashboard systems for centralized result collection.</p>

<p>That experience shaped <strong>Molotov</strong>, a lightweight Python CLI designed with a KISS
philosophy. It became just one thing: a single command to run load tests from a
single host, nothing more.</p>

<p>I still use it from time to time today whenever I need to run performance tests
on my personal and professional projects, and try to keep Molotov up-to-date.</p>
