# Blog Writing Assistant Guide

This file contains instructions for AI assistants helping with blog post creation on this Jekyll-based blog.

## Pre-Approved Tools and Permissions

The following tools are pre-approved for use when working on this blog:

### Web Research
- `WebFetch(domain:blog.mozilla.org)` - Mozilla blog posts
- `WebFetch(domain:hacks.mozilla.org)` - Mozilla Hacks technical articles
- `WebFetch(domain:firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org)` - Firefox documentation
- `WebFetch(domain:dig.watch)` - Digital Watch Observatory
- `WebSearch` - General web search for research

### Jekyll Operations
- `Bash(bundle exec jekyll build)` - Build the static site
- `Bash(bundle exec jekyll serve)` - Serve site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Blog Post Creation Workflow

### 1. Research Phase
- Use the Explore agent to understand blog structure and style
- Read existing blog posts in `_posts/` to understand tone and format
- Use WebFetch and WebSearch to gather information about the topic
- Read relevant Mozilla documentation and blog posts

### 2. Post Structure

**File naming:** `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-title-slug.md`

**Frontmatter template:**
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Tarek Ziade"
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4]
---
```

**Content structure:**
1. Opening paragraph (no heading) - sets context and hooks reader
2. Main sections with `##` headings (never use `#`)
3. Personal insights and lessons learned
4. Optional: "Useful links" section at end

### 3. Writing Style Guidelines

**Tone:**
- First-person, conversational, reflective
- Technical but accessible
- Honest about learning journey and mistakes
- Professional but personal

**Content:**
- 50-120 lines typical (~2000-4000 words)
- Break into logical sections with clear headings
- Include concrete examples and technical details
- Share both successes and challenges
- End with actionable insights or forward-looking thoughts

**Punctuation:**
- Do NOT use em-dashes (—)
- Use periods to separate sentences
- Use colons (:) for introducing lists or explanations
- Use parentheses () for parenthetical information
- Use commas appropriately for flow

**Topics:**
- AI and machine learning in browsers
- Firefox development and features
- Privacy-first design
- Web platform technology
- Software engineering practices
- WebNN and browser APIs

**Common patterns:**
- Start with compelling hook or problem statement
- Section-based organization
- Balance technical depth with readability
- Include links to related resources
- Discuss open questions and future directions

### 4. Tags

Common tags used (choose 3-4 relevant ones):
- AI, Machine Learning, Firefox, Privacy, Browsers
- Web, WebNN, PDF.js, Accessibility, Local AI
- Add new tags as appropriate for the topic

### 5. Building and Testing

**Build the site:**
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

**Preview locally:**
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:4000/

**Auto-regeneration:** The serve command watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically.

### 6. Asset Management

**Images:**
- Store in `/assets/img/`
- Reference in posts: `{{ '/assets/img/filename.jpg' | relative_url }}`
- Use `loading="lazy"` attribute

**CSS:**
- Custom styles in `/assets/css/custom.css`
- Avoid inline styles

## Key Technical Details

### Site Configuration

## Workflow Summary

1. **Research:** Explore repo, read existing posts, gather information
2. **Draft:** Create post in `_posts/` with proper frontmatter
3. **Build:** Run `bundle exec jekyll build`
4. **Preview:** Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and review at localhost:4000
5. **Iterate:** Make changes, auto-rebuild, review again
6. **Finalize:** Ensure all links work, tags are appropriate, style is consistent

## Tips for Efficiency

- Use parallel tool calls when gathering information
- Read multiple blog posts simultaneously to understand style
- WebFetch Mozilla resources before drafting to get accurate technical details
- Keep post focused on 3-4 main points rather than trying to cover everything
- Balance technical depth with storytelling
- Always include "Useful links" section with relevant resources
